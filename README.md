JumpStart-iOS is a project that contains a built in remote API client that is bundled with AFNetworking 2.0.  

The RemoteAPIClient class provides RESTful CRUD operations built to tie in with the JumpStart-API project. 

The ViewController.m class provides a sample of how to interact with the RemoteAPIClient.  Test your API connection by updating the endPointURLBase variable and running the JumpStart-iOS project. 

Simply add the â€˜JumpStart' folder to your iOS project to get started.
